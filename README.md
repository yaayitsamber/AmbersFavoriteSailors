File I/O Project for Java 2015 Course at San Diego City College
An assigned program for my Java programming course with Dr. Larry Forman. This project was fun to complete and also very challenging.
I think there are still some errors here, for instance its a bit buggy when trying to append names to the file after reading.
It was still an amazing learning experience in understanding the elements of file input and output.
